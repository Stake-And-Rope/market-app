* Linux-based Operating Systems
* PostreSQL - Install, Configure and work with database
* Qt Framework
* Git/GitHub
* Project Management and Team-work

The application simulates an online store in form of a desktop application. The backend is written in Python, the user interface is made with Qt framework using the Python libraries. MarketApp is using PostgreSQL database to store it's data on Linux Debian server running 24/7 on a Linode Cloud. 

Every user can register his own account from the `Register` form and using it's credentials to Login in the application. The main menu consists of sepparated layouts, giving the user possibility to edit his account, to walk around the categories and the products, and to create a new order introducing the data for the payment and the delivery.
